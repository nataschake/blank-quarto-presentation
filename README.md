This is a [presentation]([url](https://github.com/nataschake/sample-quarto-for-decktape/blob/master/markdown/sample/presentation.html)) highlighting possibilities of Quarto publishing system.

Quarto reveal.js slides can be published in PDF with decktape.
The command is
```
decktape presentation.html presentation.pdf
```
Result:
decktape cuts long scrollable slides.

There is a need to have such long slides published in several pages, but preserving all the text/code.
